            <p>Adam Levine is going to rock your world!</p>
            <p>Together with his compatriots the Maroon 5,
                Adam is set for world domination. Just you wait and see.
            </p>
            <p>Adam Levine has been on the scene since the end 1990s.
                His talent hasn't always been recognized or fully appreciated.
                In the early days, he was often unfavorably compared to bigger, similarly named
                artists. That's all in the past now.

            <p>
                Maroon 5 have been around, in one form  or another, for almost as long. It's only in the past
                few years that the Maroon 5 have settled down to their current, stable lineup.
                Now they're a rock-solid bunch: methodical and dependable.
